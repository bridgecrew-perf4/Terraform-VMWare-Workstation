# Terraform to build a instances on VMWare Workstation

<pre>
Ubuntu Workstation 20.04
- Terraform 0.17.4
- VM Ware Workstation 16 Pro

On Ubuntu 20.04 running VMWare Workstation 16 Pro and need to build a Windows VM with NAT network, 4 gig memory, 30 gb disk, user "john" with pass "mypassword", in a single execution? (I have the windows 10 ISO)?

DIST for Windows in /home/ej/iso/Windows10.iso

No key or licenses as this is a 30/90 eval
